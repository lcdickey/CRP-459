    I've been fortunate throughout my life to have traveled extensively, and I don't plan on stopping that habit. Besides travel, I also enjoy:
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Binge-watching shows on Netflix</li>
        <li>Working on cars (mostly on my Jeep) </li>
        <br>
    One of my favorite places that I've visited would have to be Seoul, South Korea. My parents lived there for about four years and I was able to stay there for more than a month and it was incredible. It's very clean, easy to navigate, and more interesting than most other cities.
